A short overview over the capabilities of the AsciiDoc markup language and benefits of using it for software documentation.

== Formatting

Text formatting in AsciiDoc works similar to markdown (JIRA, github) or wikitext (wikipedia):

=== Headers

There are 6 levels of headers:

= Header level 1
== Header level 2
=== Header level 3
==== Header level 4
===== Header level 5
====== Header level 6

=== Text formatting

normal, _italic_, *bold*, +mono+. +
``double quoted'', `single quoted'. +
normal, ^super^, ~sub~.

(C) (R) (TM) -- ... -> <- => <= &#182;

''''

=== Paragraphs

.normal linewrapped paragraph
Vogon poetry is, of course, the third worst in the universe. The second worst is that of
the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their poet master Grunthos the Flatulent of
his poem "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning",
four of the audience members died of internal hemorrhaging and the president of the Mid-
Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived only by gnawing one of his own legs off.

.literal paragraph
 Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
 Thy micturations are to me,
 As plurdled gabbleblotchits,
 On a lurgid bee,
 That mordiously hath blurted out,
 Its earted jurtles,
 Into a rancid festering confectious organ squealer.

=== Lists

.Bullet list

** first a
* second
  - second a
  - second b
